## Finance Model Explained

### Revenue
- **Fee Income**: Customer pays a fee (typically 3-5%) on transaction amount

### Costs
- **Cost of Funds**: Interest on capital deployed (prorated for transaction duration)
- **Insurance**: Credit insurance to protect against defaults
- **Operations**: Overhead, staff, technology costs

### Profitability Metrics
- **Net Profit** = Revenue - Total Costs
- **Profit Margin** = Net Profit / Revenue
- **ROE (Return on Equity)** = (Net Profit / Capital) √ó (365 / Duration) - annualized

## Example Transaction
- Amount: KES 5,000,000
- Duration: 90 days
- Fee: 4%
- Insurance: 1.5%
- Cost of Funds: 12% p.a.
- Operations: 0.5%

**Result**: ~KES 137,000 net profit, 27% ROE annualized
