## 🎬 HOW TO REVIEW

### Step 1: Read Documents in Order
```
Start here → 00_DESIGN_OVERVIEW.md
Then read → 01_EXCEL_STRUCTURE.md
Then read → 02_DATABASE_DESIGN.md
Then read → 03_UI_WIREFRAMES.md
Then read → 04_API_CONTRACTS.md
Then read → 05_USER_FLOWS.md
Then read → 06_COMPONENT_TREE.md
Finally   → 07_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

### Step 2: Visualize the System
- Look at ASCII wireframes - imagine using the UI
- Review database ER diagram - understand relationships
- Read user flows - walk through each workflow
- Check component tree - see how React app is structured

### Step 3: Validate Business Logic
- Verify Excel columns match your file ✅ (screenshot confirmed)
- Confirm manual mapping workflow makes sense
- Check provider KPIs are correct
- Validate risk scoring formulas
- Review hyperlink navigation (your request)

### Step 4: Ask Questions
- Anything unclear?
- Missing features?
- Design changes needed?
- Want to see more detail anywhere?

### Step 5: Approve or Request Changes
**Option A:** Say **"APPROVED - START BUILD"**
