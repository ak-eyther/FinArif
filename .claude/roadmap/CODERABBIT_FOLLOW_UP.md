## 🎯 Known Focus Areas (Based on .coderabbit.yaml)

CodeRabbit was configured to check for:

### **Critical: Financial Calculations**
**File**: `lib/calculations/wacc.ts`

**Likely suggestions:**
- [ ] Add more JSDoc comments explaining formulas
- [ ] Verify WACC formula matches BRD (Business Requirements Document)
- [ ] Document inclusive vs exclusive day count logic
- [ ] Add examples in JSDoc for complex calculations

**Example fix needed:**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates time-weighted average WACC for a given period
 *
 * @param startDate - Start of the period (inclusive)
 * @param endDate - End of the period (inclusive)
 * @param history - Capital source history entries
 * @returns Average WACC as decimal (e.g., 0.12 for 12%)
 *
 * @example
 * // Calculate WACC for January 2025
 * const wacc = calculatePeriodWACC(
 *   new Date('2025-01-01'),
 *   new Date('2025-01-31'),
 *   history
 * );
 * // Returns: 0.145 (14.5% average WACC)
 */
export function calculatePeriodWACC(...) { ... }
```

---

### **High Priority: Data Management**
**File**: `lib/data/capital-history-store.ts`

**Likely suggestions:**
- [ ] Add validation for immutability (test that getters don't expose internals)
- [ ] Document event sourcing pattern in file header
- [ ] Add JSDoc for all exported functions
- [ ] Verify localStorage serialization handles all edge cases

**Example fix needed:**
```typescript
/**
 * Returns all capital source history entries (IMMUTABLE)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Returns deep clones to prevent external mutations.
 * Any changes to returned objects will NOT affect the store.
 *
 * @returns Deep-cloned array of all history entries, sorted by effectiveDate (oldest first)
 *
 * @example
 * const history = getCapitalHistory();
 * history[0].effectiveDate = new Date(); // This does NOT mutate the store ✅
 */
export function getCapitalHistory(): CapitalSourceHistory[] { ... }
```

---

### **Medium Priority: UI Components**
**File**: `components/capital/AddCapitalSourceDialog.tsx`

**Likely suggestions:**
- [ ] Add client-side form validation with error messages
- [ ] Validate that amounts are positive integers
- [ ] Prevent future dates in effectiveDate picker
- [ ] Show loading state during submission
- [ ] Add error boundary for API failures

**Example fix needed:**
```typescript
// Add validation before submission
const handleSubmit = () => {
  // Validate positive amounts
  if (amount <= 0) {
    setError("Amount must be greater than 0");
    return;
  }

  // Prevent future dates
  if (effectiveDate > new Date()) {
    setError("Effective date cannot be in the future");
    return;
  }

  // Submit form...
};
```

---

### **Medium Priority: Date Utilities**
**File**: `lib/utils/date-period.ts`

**Likely suggestions:**
- [ ] Document inclusive vs exclusive day counts
- [ ] Add examples showing edge cases (leap years, month boundaries)
- [ ] Add comments for period classification logic

**Example fix needed:**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates days between two dates (EXCLUSIVE end date)
 *
 * @param startDate - Start date (included in count)
 * @param endDate - End date (NOT included in count)
 * @returns Number of days between dates (exclusive)
 *
 * @example
 * // February 1 to February 3 (exclusive)
 * getDaysBetween(new Date('2025-02-01'), new Date('2025-02-03'));
 * // Returns: 2 days (Feb 1, Feb 2 only - excludes Feb 3)
 *
 * @example
 * // Handle leap year
 * getDaysBetween(new Date('2024-02-28'), new Date('2024-03-01'));
 * // Returns: 2 days (Feb 28, Feb 29 - leap year)
 */
export function getDaysBetween(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): number { ... }
```

---

### **Low Priority: TypeScript Strictness**
**Files**: Multiple

**Likely suggestions:**
- [ ] Remove any remaining `any` types
- [ ] Add explicit return types to all functions
- [ ] Use `unknown` instead of `any` for truly dynamic types

---

## 📋 Recommended Action Plan (When Ready)

### **Step 1: Create Fix Branch**
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b fix/coderabbit-pr5-suggestions
```

### **Step 2: Group Fixes by Priority**

**Week 1: Critical (Financial Accuracy)**
- [ ] Add JSDoc to all WACC calculation functions
- [ ] Document inclusive vs exclusive logic
- [ ] Add calculation examples

**Week 2: High (Data Integrity)**
- [ ] Enhance capital-history-store documentation
- [ ] Add immutability tests
- [ ] Document localStorage edge cases

**Week 3: Medium (UX Improvements)**
- [ ] Add form validation to AddCapitalSourceDialog
- [ ] Prevent future date selection
- [ ] Add error messages

**Week 4: Low (Code Quality)**
- [ ] Remove any `any` types
- [ ] Add return type annotations
- [ ] General TypeScript improvements

### **Step 3: Create Small PRs**
Don't fix everything in one PR. Create separate PRs:
- PR 1: JSDoc improvements for calculations
- PR 2: Form validation enhancements
- PR 3: TypeScript strictness fixes

### **Step 4: Follow Standard Flow**
Each fix PR should go:
```
fix/coderabbit-X → develop → qa → uat → prod
```

## 🚨 When to Prioritize This

**Do it soon if:**
- You're onboarding new developers (better docs help)
- You're adding more financial features (need accurate formulas)
- Stakeholders ask for audit trail documentation

**Can wait if:**
- Everything works in production ✅ (it does!)
- No user complaints
- No new features planned soon

---

## 💡 Alternative: Incremental Fixes

Don't need to fix all at once. Fix opportunistically:

**When adding new features:**
- Add JSDoc to new functions
- Follow patterns from CodeRabbit suggestions

**When fixing bugs:**
- Improve related documentation
- Add validation where bugs occurred

**When refactoring:**
- Clean up TypeScript types
- Remove `any` types
