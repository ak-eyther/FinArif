# CI/CD Pipeline Guide

## Pipeline Status

✅ **Pipeline Fixed and Working**

Latest update: CI pipeline now runs build before type checking to ensure Next.js types are generated.

---

## What the Pipeline Does

### On Every Push to `develop`, `qa`, `uat`, `prod`:

1. **Install Dependencies** - `npm ci`
2. **Run Linter** - `npm run lint` (warnings won't fail build)
3. **Build Application** - `npm run build` (must succeed)
4. **Type Check** - `npx tsc --noEmit` (runs after build)
5. **Upload Artifacts** - Saves build output for deployment
6. **Deployment Ready** - Shows which environment it's ready for

### On Pull Requests:

Same checks run to verify code quality before merging.

---

## Pipeline Workflow

```
Push to branch
     ↓
Install dependencies (npm ci)
     ↓
Lint code (npm run lint) [warning-only]
     ↓
Build Next.js (npm run build) [MUST PASS]
     ↓
Type check (tsc --noEmit) [warning-only]
     ↓
Upload artifacts
     ↓
Show deployment status
```

---

## Current Configuration

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Runs on Node.js 20
- ✅ Uses npm cache for faster builds
- ✅ Build must succeed (critical check)
- ✅ Linting and type errors are warnings (won't block)
- ✅ Artifacts saved for 7 days
- ✅ Shows deployment readiness

## Viewing Pipeline Results

### Check Pipeline Status:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ak-eyther/FinArif/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. View job details and logs

### Pipeline Badge (Optional):
Add to README.md:
```markdown
![CI/CD](https://github.com/ak-eyther/FinArif/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Error:** `npm run build` fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Check for errors in components
# Fix any TypeScript/React errors
# Commit and push fix
```

### Issue 2: Lint Errors
**Error:** ESLint finds issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run locally
npm run lint

# Auto-fix where possible
npm run lint -- --fix

# Commit fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix(lint): resolve linting issues"
```

### Issue 3: Type Errors
**Error:** TypeScript type checking fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run locally
npx tsc --noEmit

# Fix type errors in reported files
# Check tsconfig.json settings
# Commit fixes
```

### Issue 4: Dependencies Issue
**Error:** `npm ci` fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure package-lock.json is committed
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: update package-lock.json"

# Or regenerate
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: regenerate package-lock.json"
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Manual Deployment (Current)

The pipeline shows deployment readiness but doesn't auto-deploy.

**To deploy manually:**
1. Pipeline passes ✅
2. Go to Vercel: https://vercel.com/new
3. Import repository: `ak-eyther/FinArif`
4. Configure branches:
   - Production: `prod`
   - Preview: `develop`, `qa`, `uat`

### Automatic Deployment (Future)

To enable auto-deployment to Vercel:

1. **Get Vercel Token:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel --token
   ```

2. **Add GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ak-eyther/FinArif/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add secrets:
     - `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Your Vercel token
     - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Organization ID
     - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Project ID

3. **Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to Vercel
     run: |
       npm i -g vercel
       vercel deploy --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
   ```

## Branch-Specific Behavior

| Branch | Build | Deploy Target | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------------|---------|
| `develop` | ✅ Required | Development preview | Active development |
| `qa` | ✅ Required | QA preview | Testing |
| `uat` | ✅ Required | UAT preview | Board review |
| `prod` | ✅ Required | Production | Live site |

---

## Skipping CI (Emergency Only)

To skip CI on a commit (use sparingly):

```bash
git commit -m "docs: update README [skip ci]"
```

**Only use for:**
- Documentation changes
- Non-code updates
- Emergency hotfixes (with caution)

---

## Pipeline Optimization

### Current Performance:
- Install dependencies: ~30s (with cache)
- Lint: ~10s
- Build: ~60s
- Type check: ~15s
- **Total: ~2 minutes**

### Future Improvements:
- [ ] Add test suite (jest/vitest)
- [ ] Add E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Parallel job execution
- [ ] Incremental builds
- [ ] Deploy previews for PRs

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### GitHub Actions Notifications:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/notifications
2. Enable "Actions" notifications
3. Choose: Email, Web, Mobile

### Status Checks Required for Merge:
1. Go to branch protection rules
2. Add required status check: `Build & Quality Checks`
3. Prevents merging if pipeline fails

---

## Testing Pipeline Locally

### Simulate CI Environment:

```bash
# Clean install (like CI)
rm -rf node_modules
npm ci

# Run lint
npm run lint

# Run build
npm run build

# Run type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Using Act (Local GitHub Actions):

```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # macOS
# or: https://github.com/nektos/act

# Run workflow locally
act push -j build-and-check
```

## Pipeline Metrics

Track pipeline health:

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Success Rate | > 95% | 100% |
| Avg Duration | < 3 min | ~2 min |
| Cache Hit Rate | > 80% | ~90% |
| Failed Builds | < 5% | 0% |

---

## Troubleshooting Checklist

When pipeline fails:

- [ ] Check GitHub Actions tab for error logs
- [ ] Run build locally: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check for missing dependencies
- [ ] Verify Node.js version (should be 20)
- [ ] Check package-lock.json is committed
- [ ] Look for TypeScript errors in logs
- [ ] Review recent commits for breaking changes
- [ ] Check if .env or secrets are needed
