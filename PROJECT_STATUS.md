## Financial Calculations Verified

### Risk Scoring ✅
- **Provider Risk:** (Default History × 40%) + (Claim Quality × 30%) + (Concentration × 30%)
- **Insurance Risk:** (Payment Delay × 50%) + (Default Rate × 50%)
- **Transaction Risk:** Average of both
- **Risk Levels:** Low (0-30), Medium (31-60), High (61-100)

### Fee Structure ✅
- Low Risk: 3%
- Medium Risk: 4%
- High Risk: 5%

### NIM Calculation ✅
```
Revenue = Claim Amount × Fee Rate
Capital Cost = (Claim Amount × Annual Rate × Days) ÷ 365
NIM = (Revenue - Capital Cost) ÷ Claim Amount
```

### P&L Calculation ✅
```
Revenue = Claim × Fee Rate
Capital Cost = (Claim × Rate × Days) ÷ 365
Operating Cost = Claim × 0.5%
Default Provision = Claim × (Risk/100) × 2%
Net Profit = Revenue - All Costs
Margin = Net Profit ÷ Claim Amount
```

**All formulas tested against BRD examples - 100% accurate**

## Git Branching Strategy

### Environment Branches Created
- **`prod`** → Production (board demo ready)
- **`uat`** → User Acceptance Testing
- **`qa`** → Quality Assurance
- **`develop`** → Active development ← **Current**
- **`main`** → Initial setup (archived)

### Workflow Configured
1. **Feature Development:** `feature/*` → `develop`
2. **QA Testing:** `develop` → `qa`
3. **UAT Review:** `qa` → `uat`
4. **Production:** `uat` → `prod`
5. **Hotfixes:** `hotfix/*` → `prod` + all branches

### CI/CD Pipeline Ready
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint validation
- Build verification
- Automated deployment to Vercel environments

**Documentation:** `.github/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`
